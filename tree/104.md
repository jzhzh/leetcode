# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

We can define a TreeNode as follows:

```python
class TreeNode(object):
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

In Python, there is only `None`. But there is no `null`. And we should use `x is None`, not `x == None`.

## Self-Solution 1

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode(object):
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]):
        res = 0
        depth = 0
        def traverse(root):
            nonlocal depth
            nonlocal res
            if root is None:
                return
            depth += 1
            if (root.left is None) and (root.right is None):
                res = max(res, depth)
            traverse(root.left)
            traverse(root.right)
            depth -= 1
            
        traverse(root)
        return res
```

Here, `Optional` in `root: Optional[TreeNode]` means root can be `TreeNode` or `None`, which means that root can exist or not exist.

When we use the global variables of the outer functions, in the inner functions, we need to have a statement such as `nonlocal depth`, which means that `depth` here is the not the local variable but the global variable of outer functions.

In this solution, we only need to traverse the binary tree and do something on front location and rear location.

## Self-Solution 2

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """ 
        if root is None: 
            return 0
        left_height = self.maxDepth(root.left) 
        right_height = self.maxDepth(root.right) 
        return max(left_height, right_height) + 1
```

We can use recursion. When we use recursive function in Python, we need to use `self.func()`.

Here, we can divide the problem to some sub-problems (sub-trees), and we can define a recursive function and use the return value of it to solve the problem.

We need to compute the maxDepth of sub-trees before computing the maxDepth of original trees. Hence, we need to put the important code on the rear location.
